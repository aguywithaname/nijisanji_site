                    Ichikara Inc. is a Japanese entertainment and technology startup currently located in the Chiyoda-ku district of Tokyo, Japan. 
                    The company was founded by Riku Tazumi at the age of 21, after suspending his studies at Waseda University in 2017. They are the parent
                     company of Nijisanji and other entertainment focused business ventures such as Yumenographia, and SLEE. Ichikara is regarded as a leader in the 
                     VTuber industry, in both technology and influence, with a collective 20 million YouTube subscribers over all their channels and major success in 
                     the digital entertainment markets they’ve entered. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The company’s mission is to create a “New Magical Experience” through the use of technology, which is also reflected in their 
                    values and actions. In order to create a magical new experience, Ichikara believes that the barrier between creators and the 
                    audience must be broken down, and by acting with consideration, speaking and acting with honesty and sincerity, as well as 
                    going the extra mile with everything you do, that any hurdle can easily be overcome.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In August 2020, the company raised ¥700 million (approx. USD $6.5 million) from external investors including SBI Investment 
                    and KLab. As of April 2021, Ichikara has over ¥2.6 billion in capital stock, including paid-in capital. With the expansion 
                    to English speaking markets later this year, it is expected that the company will experience its largest growth since its inception.

                    Started in 2018, Nijisanji is a group of Virtual YouTubers (VTubers), or more generally “Virtual Livers” when outside 
                    the YouTube platform, managed by Ichikara Inc. The project originally started as a mobile application developed by 
                    Ichikara for iPhone X using Apple’s then new Animoji tracking technology to rig facial expressions to

                    in real time. To demonstrate their proof-of-concept app to the public, the company recruited talent who would use it 
                    for streaming. These virtual streamers referred to themselves as “virtual livers” as in “virtual live streamers”. The 
                    success of the initial hires led to the group of virtual livers operating under Ichikara to be rebranded as the 
                    “Nijisanji Project”, eventually becoming one of the most prominent and successful virtual liver groups in Japan.

                    Nijisanji currently has operations in Japan, Indonesia, India, South Korea, and China (under the VirtuaReal brand). 
                    As of April 2021, there are 103 active Japanese Nijisanji members, 16 active NIJISANJI ID members, 
                    3 active NIJISANJI IN members, 14 active NIJISANJI KR members, and 36 active VirtuaReal members.

                    Yumenographia (which could be literally translated as Dream Graphia) is a modern evolution of the classic hostess 
                    club/bars common in Tokyo's nightlife districts or the maid cafés found in Akihabara. Ichikara’s café style service allows customers to sit and chat one-on-one with 
                    a virtual character (known as the cast members) while sipping on non-alcoholic drinks and playing games in a virtual space. 
                    For 4000 yen per 30 minutes, a customer can put on a VR headset or use their computers to interact with a Yume no Graphia cast
                     member using a VR avatar.

                <p>
                    As of April 2021, there are 33 members that you can choose to spend time with. Each Yumenographia
                      cast member has their own unique design and personality, so a customer is bound to find someone who matches their tastes.

                    The SLEE idol project aims to do everything a regular idol group does – but with a twist. Instead of participating only in regular idol 
                    activities like concerts and handshake events, SLEE aims to break down the barrier between fans and idol by having their talent interact 
                    with the community through streams and content creation on social media platforms, such as YouTube, as well. 
                    As of April 2021, SLEE is made up of two members, Nagisa Hime and Minori Momohara.
