                             A NEET vampire gamer who has been leaching off his parents and living with a pet pig who takes care of 
                            his belongings. He is whimsical, and carefree and has a habit of getting carried away. He is a constantly cash-strapped, causing 
                            him to have a strong love for money.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Personality and Streams:</strong>
                            As mentioned before, he is a game addict and hopeless NEET, who also happens to be a vampire. As a VTuber, 
                            Kuzuha possesses an incredible capacity to entertain viewers due to his snappy comebacks and unexpected reactions. 
                            Kuzuha is very frank with members he's close with but is a bundle of anxiety in large gatherings. Excellent singer, 
                            excellent FPS player, very open with his desires (money and blood), and unabashedly cute at times.

                            A second-year high school student. She has a tsundere, seiso (wholesome) personality nature while trying to be a serious class president. 
                            Even though she does her best, she sometimes feels her efforts are in vain. She often wonders if she spoke too much after giving 
                            a speech and feels depressed afterwards.

                            A high school class rep with an interest in creative/unconventional humor. As one of the first to debut, 
                            her style helped shape Nijisanji and the Vtuber streaming scene as a whole. Regarded as “the face of Nijisanji”,
                             she is highly respected amongst her peers and those in the industry, with many attributing her as the reason to 
                             why they became a VTuber. Her streams cover a wide variety of content from talking, games, music, and unique 
                             collabs/skits. She has a vast number of interests and experiences which makes her chatting streams (zatsudan) 
                             all the more enjoyable with her talent for storytelling.

                             He’s a prankster at heart and loves to tell pointless lies to trick people whenever he gets a chance. 
                             While he is best known for FPS games both niche and major, he dabbles in a wide variety of genres from 
                             simulation to MMORPGs. He has yet to go a full 24 hours without having streamed on at least 
                             one streaming platform ever since debuting.

                            A second-year high school student who loves games and cats. She began streaming her game playthroughs as a way to make friends.
                            She is usually cheerful and a bit of an airhead, but when she plays games...?!
                            For some reason, she always wears a sunflower on her head, and when she has a bad day, she uses it to read fortunes.

                            Despite being an airhead and mathematically inept, she is surprisingly skilled in Adobe After Effects and helps 
                            others create music videos for their own channels. After joining Nijisanji, she overcame her self-esteem issues and 
                            now shines with her strong personality and sense of individuality.

                            <strong>Official description:</strong>
                            The second princess of the Helesta Kingdom.
                            She is a top student in both literary and military arts. Her close friends describe her to be earnest, honest, trustworthy and reliable.
                            As a qualified successor to the throne, she values daily training and communication with others.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Personality and Streams:</strong>
                            The intelligent and articulate Second Princess of the Helesta Kingdom who delivers well-rounded streaming content. 
                            Has a knack in giving witty reactions to games and during collabs; she is also clever in picking up comments 
                            and giving humorous comebacks. Very knowledgeable, prim and proper, but often uses “dark society” jokes. She 
                            is entertaining even in collabs, showing different sides depending on her streaming partner. Interesting fact: 
                            Strangely enough, although perhaps fitting of her character, she is incredibly well versed with Japanese legal 
                            law and often shares her knowledge at unexpected times.

                            She spends most of her time in a ramshackle hut studying alchemy.
                            She is researching a way to turn her body into one that is more feminine.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Personality and Streams:</strong>
                            She is a very animated Alchemist from the Helesta Kingdom with a lot of surprising (and cute)
                             quirks to her personality. She is incredibly lively and engaging on stream but many of her 
                             peers describe her as shy and nervous in person. She often talks about her (usually unfortunate) 
                             past and personal life. Enjoys a wide variety of games, especially horror, and laid-back chats. 
                             Uses Nijisanji’s “Niji3D” tech regularly for both chat and game streams, delivering upbeat, 
                             entertaining reactions.

                            The world of wizards seems to be a tough one, so she uses streaming as a way to relieve stress.

                            <strong>Personality and Streams:</strong>
                            A shy witch who claims to come from a different dimension. Her cute bubbly pattern of speech is one of her 
                            charm points. Initially a shy person who had difficulty speaking in front of others, but lately has tried 
                            to improve that aspect of herself and is slowly becoming able to joke around with her colleagues. Recently, 
                            her mischievous side has started to show, much to the chagrin of her peers. Streams usually start late at night 
                            and can be quite long. In most games, she loves interacting with her viewers and although rare, English comments as well.

                            <strong>Official description:</strong>
                            A first-year high school student with a Kansai dialect who loves games. She is actually a psychic. 
                            She has a carefree and easy-going personality, usually unconcerned about her surroundings. 
                            Perhaps because of this, she is often possessed by various spirits.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Personality and Streams:</strong>
                            Because she takes things at her own pace, her streams can either be relaxing or thrilling, depending on her mood at the time. 
                            Despite being a psychic, she is terrible with horror. Her communication skills are quite good, so collaborations streams 
                            are always refreshing and exciting. However, she can be quite mischievous and cunning. Close friends with Sasaki Saku as they 
                            knew each other before joining Nijisanji.
